Description : Euclidean Algorithm and It's Application.

The Euclidean algorithm, discussed below,
allows to find the greatest common divisor
of two numbers a and b in "O(logmin(a,b))".
The algorithm was first described in Euclid's
"Elements" (circa 300 BC), but it is possible
that the algorithm has even earlier origins.

I used the same concept to solve CodeForces Round 81 D. Same GCDs
Overall Time Complexity : O(sqrt(n))
